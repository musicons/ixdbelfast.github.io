IXD101 Deliverables
===========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. Deliverables for this module are broken into two main sections with a series of weekly deliverables for each section.



##Week 01-06 Paper 
Paper-based exercises introduce fundamental design principles developed at the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design, and beyond.  

- **Deliverable 01 Dot** - Along with your paper exercises working with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 dots this weeks deliverable is to create a background screen for your smartphone using nothing but dots and circles. Try to avoid colour as much as possible.
- **Deliverable 02 Line** - Along with your paper exercises working with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 lines this weeks deliverable is to create a background screen for your laptop using nothing but lines. Again, try to avoid colour as much as possible.   
- **Deliverable 03 Plane** – Continue with your 1, 2, 3 and 9 planes + tone and a more finely executed 9 planes + tone piece. After the paper exercises work up some multiple planes; 20 ways on computer, you can use as may planes as you wish. 

The final exercise for this week is to create a modular typeface built from planes. [Fontstruct](http://fontstruct.com) is an excellent tool to help you do this. Alternatively you could use Sketch or Illustrator.
- **Deliverable 04 Type** – 
- **Deliverable 05 Colour** –

##Week 07-12 Screen
Using the story of John Baskerville as a starting point the screen-based exercises will ground students with a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, the building blocks of web-based content.
